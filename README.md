# Predict-the-rating-of-CMS-nursing-homes in United States


The	project	develops	a	predictive	model,	based	on	the	provider	data	published	by	Medicare	
and	Medicaid,	to	predict	overall	rating	of	a	nursing	home	based	on	selected	attributes	of	
Nursing	Homes.	We have	used	two	classification	techniques	- Logistic	Regression	and	K-Nearest	
Neighbor	to	build	predictive	classification	models.	Models	are	built	based	on	data	published	as	
of	September	2017,	for all	the	50	states	in	US.

The attributes in the data set are:

1. Ownership-	Ownership	type	has	3	categories	â€“	Profit/Non-Profit	or	Government	
2. Bedcert-Number	of	beds	in	the	hospital	
3. RESTOT-	Number	of	residents	in	certified	beds	
4. INHOSP-	Providers	resides	in	hospital	
5. Exp_total	-Adjusted	Total	Nurse	Staffing	Hours	per	Resident	per	Day	
6. Adj_total-Adjusted	Total	Nurse	Staffing	Hours	per	Resident	per	Day	
7. WEIGHTED_ALL_CYCLES_SCORE-Total	weighted	health	survey	score	
8. TOT_PENLTY_CNT-Total	number	of	penalties.
